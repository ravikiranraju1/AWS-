                                                              Amazon EC2                        

•	Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

•	Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy applications faster.

•	Amazon EC2 can be used to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage.

•	 You can add capacity (scale up) to handle compute-heavy tasks, such as monthly or yearly processes, or spikes in website traffic. When usage decreases, you can reduce capacity (scale down) again.

 
Features of Amazon EC2
Amazon EC2 provides the following high-level features:
•	Instances - Virtual servers.
•	Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) - Preconfigured templates for your instances that package the components you need for your server (including the operating system and additional software).

•	Instance types
Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, networking capacity, and graphics hardware for your instances.

•	Key pairs
Secure login information for your instances. AWS stores the public key and you store the private key in a secure place.

•	Instance store volumes
Storage volumes for temporary data that is deleted when you stop, hibernate, or terminate your instance.

•	Amazon EBS volumes
Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS).

•	Regions, Availability Zones, Local Zones, AWS Outposts, and Wavelength Zones
Multiple physical locations for your resources, such as instances and Amazon EBS volumes.

•	Security groups
A virtual firewall that allows you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances, and the destination IP ranges to which your instances can connect.

•	Elastic IP addresses
Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing.

•	Tags
Metadata that you can create and assign to your Amazon EC2 resources.

•	Virtual private clouds (VPCs)
Virtual networks you can create that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS Cloud. You can optionally connect these virtual networks to your own network.


Instance Types:
Previous Generation Instance Types
•	General purpose
•	Compute optimized
•	Memory optimized
•	Storage optimized
•	Accelerated computing
•	High performance computing
	
General Instances :
 For applications that require a balance of performance and cost.
 Example: email responding systems, where you need a prompt response as well as the it should be cost effective, since it doesn’t require much processing.
 • Compute Instances:
   For applications that require a lot of processing from the CPU. 
   Example: analysis of data from a stream of data, like Twitter stream
 • Memory Instances: For applications that are heavy in nature, therefore, require a lot of RAM.
   Example: when your system needs a lot of applications running in the background i.e. multitasking. 
 • Storage Instances: For applications that are huge in size or have a data set that occupies a lot of space.
   Example: When your application is of huge size.
 • GPU Instances: For applications that require some heavy graphics rendering.
   Example: 3D modelling etc.

Pricing for Amazon EC2:
