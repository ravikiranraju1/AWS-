•	Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. You can use Route 53 to perform three main functions in any combination: domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking.

•	We can use Route 53 for all three functions in following order

	Register domain names
	Route internet traffic to the resources for your domain
	Check the health of your resources

1.	Register domain names
Your website needs a name, such as example.com. Route 53 lets you register a name for your website or web application, known as a domain name.

We can create domain in AWS or can purchase it from other websites like GoDaddy etc.

We use hosted zone in Route 53 to save the DNS records of the domain name.

2.	Route internet traffic to the resources for your domain
When a user opens a web browser and enters your domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) in the address bar, Route 53 helps connect the browser with your website or web application.

3.	Check the health of your resources
Route 53 sends automated requests over the internet to a resource, such as a web server, to verify that it's reachable, available, and functional. You also can choose to receive notifications when a resource becomes unavailable and choose to route internet traffic away from unhealthy resources.
